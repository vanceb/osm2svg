# Items listed under the "ways" level are not filled
#     These should start with "./way" in the xpath
#
# Items listed under the "areas" level are closed and filled
#     These should usually start with "./way" in the xpath, but
#     make sure that they are items that are normally areas
#     like "forests", or "landuse" items
#     You may sometimes use a "./relation" here, but see the 
#     caveats below about the use of complex items
#
# Items listed under the "complex" level are complex :-)
#     These should start with "./relation" in the xpath
#     These items can be islands in a river for example.
#     You may get varying quality of results from these items
#     Use these with caution and check the output carefully...
#
#
# To find out the tags used in openstreetmap to define each type of item search
# for "openstreetmap tag _____". This should give you an idea of the tags used
# and any alternatives you may want to try.
#
# Where I have listed examples in each section they are generally more generic
# at the top and more specific (and/or complex) lower down
#
# If you don't want to include a layer in the svg just comment it out (but
# maintain the yaml format).  If you leave it in it will take time to be
# processed, but you can always delete it in LightBurn or Inkscape later.
